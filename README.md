# Sat2Map
A GAN converting satellite images to Map images

This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks a newly emerging field in Deep Learning.This project converts a Satellite image to Map image. Pix2Pix GAN is used in the project, this can be considered as a Supervised Learning method as it is a Paired Image to Image translation which is trained on a dataset of satellite images and target map images.

## Training Results
